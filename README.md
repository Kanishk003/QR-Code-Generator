# QR-Code-Generator
The Node.js QR code generator leverages two essential npm packages: 'inquirer' and 'qr-image'. 'Inquirer' streamlines user interaction by prompting for URL input, ensuring seamless communication between the application and the user. Once the URL is provided, 'qr-image' swiftly transforms it into a QR code image. This process empowers developers to create QR codes dynamically from URLs within Node.js applications, enhancing functionality and user experience. By integrating these packages, developers can effortlessly incorporate QR code generation into their applications, facilitating tasks such as sharing URLs or embedding information in a visually accessible format. The simplicity and efficiency of this approach make it a valuable tool for enhancing user engagement and accessibility in various Node.js projects. Whether it's for generating QR codes for websites, products, or any other application-specific use case, this solution provides a versatile and intuitive means to integrate QR code functionality seamlessly into Node.js applications.
